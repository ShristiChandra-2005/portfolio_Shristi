I am a B.Tech Computer Science (AI) student at IGDTUW, passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems. With expertise in AI-driven cybersecurity, web development (Python & Django), and machine learning, I have developed multiple projects, including Student Career Guide, Apna Lucknow, Online Test Portal, and Machine Learning applications.

During my diploma in Information Technology, I demonstrated academic excellence and technical skills, securing internship offers from four companies:

✅ SPI Pvt. Ltd., Lucknow

These internships provided hands-on experience in software development, data analytics, and cybersecurity, shaping my practical understanding of the tech industry.

My journey includes participation in prestigious hackathons like Intel AI Hackathon, Goldman Sachs Hackathon, and MSME 4.0, where I developed innovative solutions for industry challenges. I have also been part of elite programs like the Goldman Sachs Possibilities Summit and Uber She++ 2025, enhancing my leadership and problem-solving abilities.
